.. py:class:: ProbDocExtractor(probability_distrib_matrix, doc_tag, word_tag=None, extractor=1, tag=True, encodew=True, vertex_label_path=None)

   Feature extractor class for Netprob2vec
   Convert graph probability matrix to a document
   specify extractor for ordered/unordered/rounded/tagged/untagged

   .. method:: ordered_probability_extractor(self)

      Ordered sequence (decreasing probability) of nodes or bin index (of
      distances) for each rooted node converted to words
      This is for networks edge-weighted with real data like gene(perhaps not
      for weights with stat data like correlation or p-values - To be tested).


   .. method:: prob_to_string_feature_extractor(self)

      Node-wise probability values for each rooted node converted to words
      Does not really work, does not create high frequency words,
      so no vocabulary created.


   .. method:: unordered_probability_extractor(self)

      Unorodered sequence of nodes (non-neg probabilities) or bin index (of
      distances or node labels) for each rooted node converted to words. For
      LFR,
      unweighted synthetic data.


   .. method:: unordered_probability_extractor_round(self)

      Ordered sequence (decreasing probability) of nodes or bin index (of
      distances) for each rooted node converted to words.  round to 2,
      to be tested properly.


   .. method:: ordered_probability_extractor_round(self)

      Ordered sequence (decreasing probability) of nodes or bin index (of
      distances) for each rooted node converted to words. round to 2,
      to be tested


   .. method:: ordered_probability_extractor_multi(self)

      Ordered sequence (decreasing probability) of nodes or bin index (of
      distances) for each rooted node converted to words
      This is for networks edge-weighted with real data like gene(perhaps not
      for weights with stat data like correlation or p-values - To be tested).


   .. method:: get_graph_document(self)


   .. method:: get_graph_document_split(self, encode=True)


   .. method:: get_tagged_doc(self, hashing_list)
